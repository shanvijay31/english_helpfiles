<h1>Language Reference - Conditional Statements</h1>

  
<p>You will often want to change the flow of your script based on a <em>condition</em> 
  or series of conditions.&nbsp; Is one number bigger than another?&nbsp; Or, 
  does a string contain a certain value?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Conditions are evaluated as <strong>true</strong> (non-zero) or <strong>false</strong> 
  (zero).&nbsp; Conditions generally use comparison <a href="lang_operators.htm">operators</a> 
  like <strong>==</strong>, <strong>&lt;&gt;</strong>, <strong>&gt;=</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following conditional statements are available in AutoIt:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;<a href="../keywords/IfElseEndIf.htm">If...Then...Else</a></li>
  <li>&nbsp;<a href="../keywords/Select.htm">Select...Case</a></li>
  <li>&nbsp;<a href="../keywords/Switch.htm">Switch...Case</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All three statements are similar and decide which code to execute depending on the 
  condition(s) given.&nbsp; Here is an example of an <a href="../keywords/IfElseEndIf.htm">If</a> 
  statement that pops up a <a href="../functions/MsgBox.htm">message box</a> depending on the value of  
  a variable.</p>
<p class="codebox">$var = -20<br>
  <br>
  If $var &gt; 0 Then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox(0, &quot;Example&quot;, &quot;$var was positive!&quot;)<br>
  ElseIf $var &lt; 0 Then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox(0, &quot;Example&quot;, &quot;$var was negative!&quot;)<br>
  Else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox(0, &quot;Example&quot;, &quot;$var was zero.&quot;)<br>
EndIf</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the example above, the expression <strong>$var &gt; 0</strong> evaluated 
  to <strong>false</strong> because the variable was less than  zero.&nbsp; When the first condition failed, the second condition was tested.  The expression <strong>$var &lt; 0</strong> evaluated to <strong>true</strong>.  This caused the If statement to execute the second MsgBox line and display <strong>&quot;$var 
  was negative!&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="../keywords/Select.htm">Select</a> statement is very similar, but 
  is generally used for situations where you want to test a large number of conditions 
  as it is generally easier to read than a large If/ElseIf type block.&nbsp; 
  e.g.</p>
<p class="codebox">$var = 30<br>
  <br>
  Select<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case $var &gt; 1 AND $var &lt;= 10<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox(0, &quot;Example&quot;, 
  &quot;$var was greater than 1&quot;)<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case $var &gt; 10 AND $var &lt;= 20<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox(0, &quot;Example&quot;, 
  &quot;$var was greater than 10&quot;)<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case $var &gt; 20 AND $var &lt;= 30<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox(0, &quot;Example&quot;, 
  &quot;$var was greater than 20&quot;)<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case $var &gt; 30 AND $var &lt;= 40<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox(0, &quot;Example&quot;, 
  &quot;$var was greater than 30&quot;)<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case $var &gt; 40<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox(0, &quot;Example&quot;, 
  &quot;$var was greater than 40&quot;)<br>
  EndSelect
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="../keywords/Switch.htm">Switch</a> statement is very similar to 
Select statement, but is generally used for situations where the same expression 
is tested against some different possible values.</p>
<p class="codebox">$var = 30<br>
  <br>
  Switch Int($var)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 1 To 10<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox(0, &quot;Example&quot;, 
  &quot;$var was greater than 1&quot;)<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 11 To 20<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox(0, &quot;Example&quot;, 
  &quot;$var was greater than 10&quot;)<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 21 To 30<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox(0, &quot;Example&quot;, 
  &quot;$var was greater than 20&quot;)<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 31 To 40<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox(0, &quot;Example&quot;, 
  &quot;$var was greater than 30&quot;)<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox(0, &quot;Example&quot;, 
  &quot;$var was greater than 40 or less or equal to 0&quot;)<br>
  <br>
  EndSwitch
</p>
<p>With each of these structures, the first condition that is true controls which group of statements get executed.  All subsequent conditions and their associated statements get ignored.</p>
